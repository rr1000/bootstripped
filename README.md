###Bootstripped V0.0.1

****

Initial release (October 2012)

Bootstripped is a CSS-Javascript-HTML framework that was built using Twitter's Bootstrap framework.

- Bootstripped utilizes multiple CSS classes within single HTML class tags as a way to build "on-top" of Twitter's existing Bootstrap foundation. One can think of boostripped as an overriding mechanism so that new users of bootstrap can easily grasp how to eliminate canned styles.

- Many of the architectural features of Bootstrap remain the same. However adding these other classes in combination with Bootstrap classes will give you a more customized look at the same time preserving the more attractive features of Bootstrap.
